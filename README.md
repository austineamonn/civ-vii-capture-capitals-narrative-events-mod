# Capture Capital Narrative Events (CCNE) Civ VII Mod

Author: Austin Nicolas

Version: 1.1.1

## Current Mod:

A narrative event occurs when capturing a Civilization's capital for the first time. The rewards include one of the traditions of the Civilization (which will carry across ages) or a promotion on a commander. Then at the start of a new age a narrative event will occur that will give you all the traditions you gained previously from capturing capitals.

Works for all Base Civilizations and DLC Civilizations, and some modded Civilizations.

## Latest Update:

Fixed bug where narrative event granting policies from previous ages would occur on turns after turn one.
